# Frontend Feature Updates

**Update Time**: 2025-10-26  
**Version**: v1.1.0

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Empty Field Validation** ✅

**Problem**: When user clicks "Add" button with empty input, there was no prompt

**Solution**:
- Added input validation logic
- Shows warning alert when input is empty: `⚠️ Please enter task content!`
- Prevents empty task submission

**Code Location**: `src/App.jsx` Lines 45-48

```javascript
// Validate input is not empty
if (text === '') {
  alert('⚠️ Please enter task content!')
  return
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Operation Feedback** ✅

Added friendly user feedback for all key operations:

#### ✅ Success Prompts
- **Add Task**: `✅ Task added successfully!`
- **Delete Task**: `✅ Task deleted`
- **Clear Completed**: `✅ Completed tasks cleared`
- **Clear All**: `✅ All tasks cleared`

#### ⚠️ Confirmation Prompts (with warning icon)
- **Delete Task**: `⚠️ Are you sure you want to delete this task?\nThis cannot be undone!`
- **Clear Completed**: `⚠️ Are you sure you want to clear all completed tasks?\nThis cannot be undone!`
- **Clear All**: `⚠️ Warning! Are you sure you want to clear all tasks?\nThis cannot be undone!`

#### ❌ Error Prompts
- **Add Failed**: `❌ Failed to add, please try again`
- **Delete Failed**: `❌ Failed to delete, please try again`
- **Clear Failed**: `❌ Failed to clear, please try again`
- **Clear All Failed**: `❌ Failed to clear, please try again`

### 3. **Accessibility Improvements** ✅

Added accessibility attributes to input field:

```jsx
<input
  type="text"
  id="new-todo"
  placeholder="Enter new task..."
  aria-label="New task input"      // ← New: Screen reader label
  title="Please enter task content"  // ← New: Hover tip
  // ...
/>
```

**Benefits**:
- Improves accessibility, supports screen readers
